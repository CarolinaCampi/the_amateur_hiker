        <h3>Hi! I'm Carolina, an avid traveller from Buenos Aires, Argentina.</h3>
        <p>During 2024, I quit my job but it wasn't to become a full-time content creator. My partner got a great opportunity to grow in his career that included a 6 months trip to London. I'm a chemist and worked as a laboratory analyst, which isn't very remote-friendly. So, we decided I would quit my job and we would see where this new path would take us. As an unexpected, but entirely welcome, result, we got to travel quite a bit. One year later, I find myself wanting to record some of these adventures and to share them with whoever might listen (or read). We had a few learnings along the way that might be useful to other travelers visiting these amazing places. If you are reading this, welcome and thank you for being here!</p>
