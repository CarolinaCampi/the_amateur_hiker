        <h1>Day trips from London: 3 countryside destinations</h1>

        <p>
            During our stay in London, we had the opportunity to visit a few of the areas and towns a train ride away.
            These
            include seaside and countryside and there is something for everyone: from trails to historic architecture. On this article I will dive into 3 countryside options.
        </p>

        <h2>Railcard and trains</h2>

        <p>Regarding British trains, I found them to work generally well: they are mostly on time and in good
            conditions. But we have experienced a few delays on different trips in the past years. It’s good to know
            that you can apply for delay repay on the webpage of the train company. The application for compensation,
            usually consisting of a long online form, is not the most user-friendly, and the pages can be finicky, but
            it can be worth it depending on the amount of time lost and the price paid for the ticket.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/london_day_trips_cover_2.webp"
            alt="2 picture collage: Train tracks in Rye station.">

        <p>Another consideration that makes travelling by train more accessible, price-wise, are railcards. <a
                href="https://www.railcard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Railcards</a> allow the owner to get 1/3 off the
            price of most train fares. There are several types of Railcards and each type has a specific criteria. For
            example, to be eligible for the 16-25 Railcard you have to be between 16 and 25 years old or in full-time
            education. Another example is Two Together Railcard where the benefit is 1/3 off for adult fares for two
            named people travelling together aged 16 and over. Most Railcardsare priced at just £35 for a 1-year
            Railcard. So, depending on how many trips, and the price of the trips, it may be a good investment for you.
            According to <a href="https://www.railcard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Railcard.co.uk</a>, “Typically, the cost
            of your Railcard will have paid for itself after 1 or 2 trips."
        </p>

        <p>Depending on the availability of ticket types, which are varied and complex in the UK train ticket system, the prices vary. Another way to save some money while travelling by train is to have date flexibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel off-peak: avoid rush hour (typically 7-9am and 5-7pm during weekdays) since it's when more
                expensive tickets are.
            </li>
            <li>Travel mid-week: try to avoid Fridays and weekends since these are usually the most expensive days to
                take the train.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Winchester</h2>

        <p>This city in the county of Hampshire sits within the South Downs National Park. Characterized by its
            mediaeval streets and the Winchester Cathedral, it's perfect for a day trip in the English countryside.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>

        <p>South Western Railway is the train company that covers the trip from London to Winchester. Specifically, the
            train departs from Waterloo station and Weymouth is the final destination. It stops in Winchester after
            passing one or two other stops. The journey lasts a little less than an hour. Trains depart every 30 minutes
            from Waterloo station, so it should be easy to take the one that’s most convenient for you. Return tickets
            start at £46.60, without a Railcard, on a weekend, while tickets on weekdays start at £41.80.</p>

            alt="3 picture collage: Winchester street, the Arc building, bridge in front of the Winchester Mill.">

        <h3>What to do</h3>

        <p>Explore the streets and narrow alleyways of the historic city center and visit the Winchester Cathedral. This
            <a href="https://visit-winchester.files.svdcdn.com/production/City-Walk-web.pdf?v=1719826555&dm=1719826557"
                target="_blank">brochure</a> suggests a possible route to walk along to hit a few of the notable
            attractions in Winchester. Walk along the River Itchen and stroll along Hockley Viaduct.
        </p>

        <p>When we visited Winchester, we were lucky and caught a festival called A Taste of WInchester that included
            lots of food stalls, activities and street performances. It seemed a great place to visit with families and
            friends alike.</p>

        <p>Here a few ideas and attractions found in the Winchester area:</p>

        <h4>Winchester Cathedral</h4>

        <p>Wander around in this beautiful building from the 11th century that is the resting place of Jane Austen. You
            can enjoy the gardens as well. If the weather is nice, the front lawn is perfect for a picnic.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/winchester_3.webp" alt="River Itchen and the trail beside it">

        <h4>Walk along the River Itchen</h4>

        <p>There is nothing like a stroll by the river following The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail. It is a 10 miles
            /
            16 km trail that can be done partially or completely. The path is well marked and mostly flat, making it
            appropriate for most visitors. The <a
                href="https://visit-winchester.files.svdcdn.com/production/Itchen-Navigation.pdf?v=1719827260&dm=1719827260"
                target="_blank">brochure</a> has additional information and a map.</p>


        <h4>Winchester City Mill</h4>

        <p>This historic mill is free to visit. It has a café with an island garden facing the river and it's considered
            a
            wildlife spot in the heart of Winchester. If you are not interested in the history of the building or the
            flour
            mill process, it's still worth a visit to see the garden.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/winchester_4.webp"
            alt="2 picture collage: Winchester Mill, Wolvesey Castle ruins">

        <h4>Wolvesey Castle</h4>

        <p> Wolvesey used to be the residence of the Bishops of Winchester in the Middle Ages. Now well preserved ruins
            dating all the way back to the 12th century, you can walk and imagine the once grand home of advisers to the
            king. Wolvesey Castle is free to enter. You can find more details <a
                href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/wolvesey-castle-old-bishops-palace/"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h4>Jane Austen's House</h4>

        <p>A bit further out of the city, you can find Jane Austen’s house, a great stopping point for literature or
            history fans. They recommended to reserved tickets in advance at <a hre="https://janeaustens.house/"
                target="_blank">https://janeaustens.house/</a>. Opening days and times should also be confirmed in the
            official site mentioned before. 2025 is the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth, so it's a busy and
            exciting year to visit the lovely Hampshire cottage.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/winchester_5.webp"
            alt="3 picture collage: Hockley Viaduct, view of the river and hills from Hockley Viaduct, King Alfred's Statue">

        <h4>Walk or bike along Viaduct Way</h4>

        <p>We only walk a part of this trail, but I highly recommend it, especially for bike lovers. You can find the
            brochure with the map and additional information <a
                href="https://visit-winchester.files.svdcdn.com/production/Viaduct-Way.pdf?v=1719830134&dm=1719830134"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The trail passes through several Winchester attractions like the Victorian Guildhall, King Alfred’s Statue
            and
            Wolvesey Castle. It includes Hockley Viaduct, where you can stop and gaze into the surrounding fields and
            river.</p>

        <h4>Other options</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Take part in a ghost tour</li>
            <li>Marvell Zoo</li>
            <li>Explore the South Downs</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Surrey Hills: Box Hill</h2>

        <p>The Surrey Hills National Landscape is an area southwest of London. A few of the places you can visit within
            in are Box Hill, Leith Hill and Hindhead Commons and the Devils Punch Bowl.</p>

        <p>When we visited, we went to a trail in the Box Hill area specifically.</p>

        <div class="logistics">
            <h3>Surrey Hills resources</h3>
            <ul>

        </div>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/box_hill_0.webp" alt="View of the Surrey Hills from the Box Hill circular">

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>

        <p>Starting at Waterloo station, get on the South Western Railway train headed to Dorking. Ride it for 13 stops
            and 47 minutes and get off the train at Box Hill & Westhumble station. </p>

        <p>The tickets start at £15.50 for a return journey without a Railcard any day of the week.</p>

        <p>Take advantage of the view on the second leg of the trip. The hills start to appear and the landscape is
            beautiful.</p>

        <h3>What to do</h3>

        <p>Once you get to Box Hill station, there are a bunch of trails on the Surrey Hills characteristic of the area.
            You can walk to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdkgphtQttxzdmin8" target="_blank">Box Hill Shephard’s Hut
                Information Stand</a> where there are toilets, maps with possible trails, a parking lot and a café, so
            it’s a good starting point.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/box_hill_1.webp"
            alt="3 picture collage: dirt trail in a grassy hill, short stone tower, trail bordered by green trees and shrubs">

        <p>We followed <a
                href="https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/england/surrey/box-hill-lodge-hill-and-juniper-hill-circular"
                target="_blank">this trail</a> but we got lost near the end. And instead of retracing our steps we
            decided to head over to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AuRA9F75ZjmifycT9" target="_blank">Stepping
                Stones</a>. From the Stepping Stones, we headed back to the station.</p>

        <p class="recommendation">Note: If you are going to embark on one of the longer trails, be mindful to carry sufficient
            water and food with you. Some of the trails don't have places to replenish along the way.</p>
            
        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/oxford_0.webp"
            alt="Christ Church Hall">

        <h2>Oxford</h2>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>
        <p>To get to Oxford, Great Western Railway direct trains leave from Paddington every 30 minutes. The journey lasts 55 minutes and has 2 stops along the way. Off-Peak Day Return tickets start at £37.10 for any day of the week without a Railcard.</p>

        <h3>What to do</h3>
        
        <p>Oxford is a very popular destination when escaping the hustle and bustle of London. It’s easy to get to and presents the visitor with iconic architecture featured in many movies.</p>

        <h4>Christ Church College</h4>
        <p>Inmortalized in Harry Potter films, this college features stunning architecture surrounded by lush green and the River. If you wish, you can take a tour of some of the buildings. I recommend taking a relaxing stroll around the Christ Church Meadow, which borders the river for most of the path. If you continue past The Watcher Tree, you can go to the Botanical Garden after.</p>
