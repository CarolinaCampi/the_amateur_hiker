        <h1>Day trips from London: 3 seaside destinations</h1>

        <p>
            During our stay in London, we had the opportunity to visit a few of the areas and towns a train ride away.
            These
            include seaside and countryside and there is something for everyone: from trails to historic architecture. On this article I will dive into 3 seaside options.
        </p>

        <h2>Railcard and trains</h2>

        <p>Regarding British trains, I found them to work generally well: they are mostly on time and in good
            conditions. But we have experienced a few delays on different trips in the past years. It’s good to know
            that you can apply for delay repay on the webpage of the train company. The application for compensation,
            usually consisting of a long online form, is not the most user-friendly, and the pages can be finicky, but
            it can be worth it depending on the amount of time lost and the price paid for the ticket.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/london_day_trips_cover_2.webp"
            alt="2 picture collage: Train tracks in Rye station.">

        <p>Another consideration that makes travelling by train more accessible, price-wise, are railcards. <a
                href="https://www.railcard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Railcards</a> allow the owner to get 1/3 off the
            price of most train fares. There are several types of Railcards and each type has a specific criteria. For
            example, to be eligible for the 16-25 Railcard you have to be between 16 and 25 years old or in full-time
            education. Another example is Two Together Railcard where the benefit is 1/3 off for adult fares for two
            named people travelling together aged 16 and over. Most Railcardsare priced at just £35 for a 1-year
            Railcard. So, depending on how many trips, and the price of the trips, it may be a good investment for you.
            According to <a href="https://www.railcard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Railcard.co.uk</a>, “Typically, the cost
            of your Railcard will have paid for itself after 1 or 2 trips."
        </p>

        <p>Depending on the availability of ticket types, which are varied and complex in the UK train ticket system, the prices vary. Another way to save some money while travelling by train is to have date flexibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel off-peak: avoid rush hour (typically 7-9am and 5-7pm during weekdays) since it's when more
                expensive tickets are.
            </li>
            <li>Travel mid-week: try to avoid Fridays and weekends since these are usually the most expensive days to
                take the train.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/brighton_0.webp" alt="Brighton beach view of Palace Pier">

        <h2>Brighton</h2>
        <p>Brighton is an iconic seaside town in East Sussex, England, 47 miles / 76 km south of London. Connected with
            a direct train, it's one of the classic day trips to take when visiting London to breathe fresh sea air.</p>

        <p>When we visited, the day was overcast and it rained on and off through out the day. With the help of rain
            jackets and umbrellas, we managed to wander around and visit most of what we had in mind.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>
        <p>London and Brighton are connected by the Thameslink train. You can hop on this train in several stations in
            London such as London Bridge, London St Pancras’ International and London Blackfriars. This makes it one of
            the more convenient day trips from London, as you are not tied to a specific station and can choose the most
            practical one for you.</p>
        <p>Tickets start at £23.80 for an Off-Peak Day Return. Depending on the availability of ticket types, which are
            varied and complex in the UK train ticket system, the prices could be higher. It’s more likely to get
            cheaper tickets when purchased in advance and for weekday trips.</p>
        <p>The train ride lasts around 1 hour, depending on which station you hop on, with few stops along the way.</p>


        <h3>What to do</h3>
        <p>To start with, as is the case with many destinations, I would recommend walking around and exploring. Most
            attractions are walking distance from the station. There are cute smaller side streets and alleys worth
            visiting. Don't forget to get fish and chips and ice cream.

        <p>There are a few classic landmarks in Brighton that you could include in your visit.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/brighton_5.webp" alt="Brighton beach view">

        <h4>Brighton Beach</h4>
        <p>A must see on every trip to Brighton is the beach. Even on an overcast day, as the one with had, you can walk
            along the shore, sit and relax and try to spot France. It's a shingle beach and most days you will see
            somebody taking a dip.

        <h5>Piers</h5>

        <p>The only thing that remains from the first of Brighton’s piers, the Chain Pier, are weathered pillars of
            stone
            and wood that can be seen in low tide to the right of the still standing Palace Pier.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/brighton_3.webp" alt="Palace Pier in Brighton">

        The Palace Pier, formally known as Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, features a funfair including fairground
        rides, arcade halls and food stands.
        We visited on a rainy day where most of the outdoors rides and features were closed. I would still recommend
        sitting in one of the benches facing the sea and enjoying the view for a while.

        <h4>Brighton i360</h4>

            and
            down the main structure, rising to 138 metres above the ground, making it the highest British observation
            tower
            outside of London.</p>

        <h2>Dover + Canterbury</h2>

        <p>While the combination might be a bit random, both cities are to the east of London and, if you want to
            maximize the bang for your buck and train time, combinations like this one might be for you. You can see the
            coast and get the typical mediaeval town experience on the same outing.</p>
        
        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/dover_canterbury_0.webp"
            alt="2 picture collage: White cliffs of Dover with grey sky, Canterbury canal with old buildings on the side">

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>

        <p>To get to Dover from London, you have to go to St Pancras International station and take the Southeastern
            train headed to Ramsgate. After 6 stops and 66 minutes, you will arrive at Dover Priory, where you need to
            get off the train. The cost for this leg of the trip starts at £22.30 without a Railcard on weekends and
            £18.30 for weekdays.</p>

        <p>After you visited Dover, go back to the Dover Priory station and take the Southeastern train headed to London
            Victoria. This might seem weird, but this service passes through Canterbury. The train takes half an hour to
            get there and has 7 stops before reaching Canterbury East station. The tickets for this journey start at
            £11.00, for any day of the week.</p>

        <p>Finally, when you are ready to go back to London, walk to Canterbury West station. There are alternatives for
            this leg:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Southeastern train to St Pancras International station. The ride lasts around an hour and has 4 stops.
                These tickets start at £18.20.
            </li>
            <li>Southeastern train to London Charing Cross station. The ride lasts 1 hour and 47 minutes and has 13
                stops. These tickets start at £13.50.
            </li>
            <li>Southeastern train towards London Victoria station. The ride lasts around an hour and a half and has 10
                stops. These tickets start at £16.30.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>While the train ride to St Pancras International is the shortest, it might be more convenient and/or overall
            faster for you to take one of the other trains, if it means less time in the Tube/bus within London.</p>

            alt="2 picture collage: White cliffs of Dover with grey sky, Canterbury canal with old buildings on the side">

        <h3>What to do in Dover</h3>

        <p>I can’t quite place how the idea of visiting Dover was planted in my brain. I have a slight suspicion that it
            happened reading an extract or a poem in English Literature class when I was a teen. In any case, I knew I
            wanted to visit the famous White Cliffs. The draw for some people is the rich history associated with WWI
            and WWII. You can take a ferry to France from Dover and, on clear days, you can see France from the coast of
            Dover.</p>

        <p>When we arrived at the station, it was raining and we could not see France at all. So we put on our raincoats
            and headed to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/32FdfukPJNvGvpEk8" target="_blank">The White Cliffs of
                Dover</a>. On the way we stopped for hash browns and a coffee at <a
                href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nQjCVgdyzk8RVN549" target="_blank">Costa Coffee</a>. We continued walking
            and arrive to the start of the trail, where you can do a toilet <a
                href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HZJfGbSrEv2gRGbo6" target="_blank">stop</a>.</p>
        
        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/dover_2.webp"
        alt="Path on the cliff face part of Langdon Stairs that descends to Langdon Bay, with a person giving their back to the camera dressed in blue raincoat.">

        <p>The path is easy to follow and there are <a
                href="https://nt.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website/national/regions/kent/places/the-white-cliffs-of-dover/pdf/white-cliffs-map-web-nov-22_1.pdf">maps</a>
            available as well. We followed the trail all the way to the South Foreland Lighthouse.</p>

        <p>It took us about an hour with many stops for pictures along the way, because of the beautiful views. The path
            is mostly flat with a few ups and downs. It's well maintained, so no special shoes are needed. Though I do
            recommend comfortable walking shoes, sport shoes or hiking shoes.</p>

        <p>On the other side of the path, you will find tall grasses, fields of flowers and a few shrubs and trees, the
            perfect complement to the stark cliffs.</p>

        <p>In the lighthouse area, we stopped to rest for a bit and had a snack we brought with us. There is a shop with
            a few offerings, but I would recommend taking your own as back up, or in case you feel peckish along the
            way.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/dover_3.webp"
            alt="South Foreland Lighthouse on the background of green grass fields with grey skies.">

        <p>On the way back, we took a small detour and descended Langdon Stairs on to Langdon Bay. The descent includes
            a tunnel into the cliff, after which you emerge to vertical stairs that lead to the beach itself. It's quite
            an experience if you are up for it. We sat for a bit enjoying the view and the sound of the waves.</p>

        <p class="recommendation"><b>Recommendation</b>: The Langdon Stairs and Bay have rougher terrain with
            a steeper descent and uneven ground. Be prepared for this if you want to visit this part. Another important
            thing to keep in mind is the tide. The beach is very short and susceptible to changes in sea levels. While
            visiting, always be vigilant of the tide to avoid accidents.</p>

        <p>Another of the features of The White Cliffs of Dover is the presence of tunnels dug under the order of
            Winston Churchill. The Fan Bay Deep Shelter was discovered relatively recently by the National Trust and was
            reopened in 2015 to visitors. The labyrinth of tunnels go deep and include 125 steps to get to them.</p>

        <h3>Canterbury</h3>

        <p>Canterbury is a cathedral city and pilgrimage destination. It has a rich history spanning many centuries and
            is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The historic center is surrounded by ancient walls and it's where we
            started our visit.</p>

        <h4>Canterbury City Walls</h4>

        <p>One of the first things you see when leaving Canterbury East station, are the <a
                href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CYmyW5RtwmytoRgt6" target="_blank">Canterbury City Walls</a>. You can walk
            along them and visit the neighbouring <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/q41XWjd5edPqBwit6"

        <h4>Canterbury Cathedral</h4>

        <p>From the city walls, you can make your way through the cobbled streets to the Canterbury Cathedral. Dating
            back to the 11th century, it was the site of many historical events throughout the years and still remains
            as a relevant pilgrimage site. Don’t forget to include the Cathedral’s Cloisters and green spaces in your
            visit.</p>
