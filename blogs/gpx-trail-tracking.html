        <h1>How not to get lost while hiking: practical guide for the use of GPX files</h1>

        <p>After many requests for this tutorial (well, only from my sister and a friend), I put together this brief
            step-by-step guide on how to use gpx files for trail tracking using the GPS on your phone. In other words,
            how
            to try not to get lost while out on a trail.</p>

        <p>For some context, GPX stands for GPS Exchange Format and its a text-based file (.gpx) that stores geographic
            data like waypoints and routes. This allows users to track their position while hiking, cycling, or running
            making it easier to follow pre-defined paths on various devices.</p>

        <h2>Where can you get .gpx files?</h2>

        <img src="../data/gpx-trail-tracking/gpx-trail-tracking-1.png"
            alt="Screenshot of the Alltrails website Home screen. It cointains a Navigation bar, a Search bar and suggests trails near the user location.">

        <h3>AllTrails</h3>
        <p>I find most of my .gpx files in alltrails.com. It's one of the most popular sources and contains most trails.
            You have to create a user to be able to download the .gpx files. It has paid plans but the free tier has
            everything I need from it. In this guide, I will focus on the use of alltrails, given as it may not be the
            most
            user-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Other sources for .gpx files</h3>
        <p>In the past, I have also used some other more specific sites for certain destinations like <a
                href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/steallfalls.shtml">this one</a> for Scottish trails
            and <a href="https://www.walkingclub.org.uk/walks/map.html">this other one</a> for trails in the UK in
            general.</p>
        <p>There are also many blogs from sports enthusiasts that contain the files showing the trail they followed on
            their own adventures.</p>

        <h2>How do you use .gpx files?</h2>

        <img src="../data/gpx-trail-tracking/gpx-trail-tracking-2.png"
            alt="Screenshot of the Google Play Store website for the GPX Viewer app.">

        <p>This type of files need to be opened by an app that can read and interpret them correctly. I have an Android
            phone and use <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vecturagames.android.app.gpxviewer&hl=en">GPX
                Viewer</a> that has a free version with enough features to be functional for my use.</p>

            <li>
                <p>If you are want to explore possible trails in an area, you can search for the area or point of
                    interest
                    on the Search bar. For example: Loch Lomond.</p>

            <li>
                <p>From the area profile, you will be able to browse through the available options in the area in a list
                    or
                    directly in the map. If you hover over a certain pin, the route will be displayed in bright green on
                    the
                    map along with the name of the trail.</p>

            <li>
                <p>If the black pin has a number on it, the number indicates the amount of trails that the pin is
                    representing. If you click on the pin, you can scroll to the right to see the trails included.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Within the trail's profile, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>read an overview description of the trail</li>
                    <li>review the route by clicking the map rectangle</li>
                    <li>see photos uploaded by other users</li>
                    <li>check reviews and comments for the trail. This can be particularly seful to check for updated
                        trail conditions (e.g.: if its muddy or in bad shape).</li>
                    <li>find nearby trails</li>

            <li>
                <p>On the map view of the trail, you can check on the specific route the gpx will guide you through and
                    the
                    elevation along the way as well. It can be useful as well to use this feature to look for the
                    closest
                    train station, if it's not specified in the trail description.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This will download a .gpx file to your computer or phone. Send the file to the phone you will use to
                    navigate the trail with.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Once you have the .gpx file on the desired device, open it with an app that can read this type of
                    files.
                    As mentioned above, the one I use is called GPX Viewer, only available on Android. When you open the
                    .gpx with the app, it shows the whole trail, superimposed on the Google Maps map.</p>
                <img class="phone-screenshot" src="../data/gpx-trail-tracking/gpx-trail-tracking-15.jpg"
                    alt="Screenshot of the Alltrails website Home screen. It cointains a Navigation bar, a Search bar and suggests trails near the user location.">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you tap the light blue trail, the profile of the trail is shown, where the elevation of the walk
                    is
                    clearly displayed.</p>
                <img class="phone-screenshot" src="../data/gpx-trail-tracking/gpx-trail-tracking-16.jpg"
                    alt="Screenshot of the Alltrails website Home screen. It cointains a Navigation bar, a Search bar and suggests trails near the user location.">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can zoom in to the trail and see specific sections in more detail and follow you location in
                    relation with the trail.</p>
                <img class="phone-screenshot" src="../data/gpx-trail-tracking/gpx-trail-tracking-17.jpg"
                    alt="Screenshot of the Alltrails website Home screen. It cointains a Navigation bar, a Search bar and suggests trails near the user location.">
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once you have the .gpx file loaded and ready to go, you do not need to have phone signal or mobile data
            available for the navigation to work, because it relies on the phone's GPS signal. This makes it ideal for
            remote places where signal is spotty. I also love to be able to track how much I have walked,
            elevation-wise. There's nothing more gratifying that realizing you have finished the ascent part of a trail
            and its only downhill from there. Happy hiking!</p>
