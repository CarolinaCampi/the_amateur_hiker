        <h1>6 London day trips</h1>

        <p>Even though I’ve been wanting to visit Cornwall ever since watching About time, I was recently reminded of
            this fact while binge-watching the delightful first season of The Bucaneers. The dramatic coastline cut by
            staggering cliffs could possibly captivate just about anyone, including me. So, it was easy to choose it as
            the destination for a 4-day getaway from London. Here, I will share my itinerary along with practical
            information about the attractions included as well as a few of my opinions.
        </p>

                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Price: starting at 14.50 pounds for adults and 8.60 pounds for children
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>Notes: there is quite a bit of walking involved, most of which is on uneven terrain. So, take
                    appropriate footwear and rain-proof layers, if the weather requires it.</li>
                <li>
                    The access to the castle includes a road with a steep incline. You can hire a van to take you down
                    (and up when leaving) the access road.

                <li>If the weather is nice, there is an open beach by Merlin's Cave where you can take a dip.</li>

        <p class="recommendation"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> pack some lunch and snacks and take advantage of the picnic tables near Fingle Bridge.</p>
