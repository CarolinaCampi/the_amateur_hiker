        <h1>Cornwall Getaway</h1>

        <p>Even though I’ve been wanting to visit Cornwall ever since watching About time, I was recently reminded of
            this fact while binge-watching the delightful first season of The Bucaneers. The dramatic coastline cut by
            staggering cliffs could possibly captivate just about anyone, including me. So, it was easy to choose it as
            the destination for a 4-day getaway from London. Here, I will share my itinerary along with practical
            information about the attractions included as well as a few of my opinions.
        </p>

        <h2>4-day itinerary</h2>

        <p>We left London early on a Friday and returned late on the following Monday, but feel free to use this
            itinerary on the days that better suit your needs. This post includes opening hours as of January 2025, so
            be aware of possible closing days.</p>

        <h3>Day 1: London → Tintagel</h3>
        <p>We left our accommodation in London with our carry ons at 7 in the morning and headed to Paddington Station.
            Our train was due to leave at 8:03. We chose this particular time, instead of a later one, in order to take
            full advantage of the first day of the mini vacation. Besides, the 2 hour train ride was perfect for a
            morning nap (You might be thinking, who takes naps in the morning? The answer is me, I take naps in the
            morning and they are delightful. You should give them a go).</p>

        <p>We arrived at Exeter St Davis station at 10:07 then switched to a local train to Marsh Barton, where the car
            rental office was. The change was seamless, only having to wait in the station a short while, which was good
            to stretch our legs a bit.</p>

        <p>Then we walked to the rental office. Not going to lie, this walk was not exactly picturesque, given as its a
            warehouses’ and car sellers’ area, but it was practical enough for our purpose.</p>

        <p>We rented in the Marsh Barton Hertz office, because it had the best price at the time. We got the cheapest
            car available and got a Vauxhall Corsa. We could fit our staff easily in the trunk and it was moderately
            small, which was what we were looking for.</p>

        <p class="recommendation"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Rent the smallest car possible that is still
            functional to you, especially if you are not a seasoned driver on this type of road. The streets and roads
            in Cornwall are usually quite narrow or even single lane in some stretches. A small car will probably give
            the driver, and the rest of the people in the car, if any, more peace of mind on the road.</p>

        <p>When we were strapped in and ready to go in our rental, we started the drive to Tintagel Castle, our first
            attraction of the trip. We had around an hour and a half to marvel at the rolling hills and listen to the
            amazing audiobook for Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir (strongly recommend).</p>

        <p>Hunger was starting to creep in. Luckily we were arriving at Tintagel village and were already visualizing
            the cornish pasties we were going to devour soon. We parked the car here
            (https://maps.app.goo.gl/VtrBEi9zhv8Qisdm7).</p>

        <p class="recommendation"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> You have to pay upon arrival and leave the ticket
            displayed on the console of the car. Be careful when taking the ticket from the Parking totem if it’s windy.
            Several people found themselves chasing it around the parking lot unsuccessfully.</p>

        <p>We started walking from the parking lot to Tintagel Castle along the main street (Fore St). There you can
            find a bunch of little restaurants and shops; it’s the perfect spot for lunch, whether you want something
            quick, like we did, and something slower and more relaxed, like a sit down place. We ate a delicious cornish
            pasty here (https://maps.app.goo.gl/A5QcSX4q7t1oPtQk8). After that, walked over to Tintagel Castle. </p>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>Notes: there is quite a bit of walking involved, most of which is on uneven terrain. So, take
                    appropriate footwear and rain-proof layers, if the weather requires it.</li>
                <li>
                    The access to the castle includes a road with a steep incline. You can hire a van to take you down
                    (and up when leaving) the access road.
                </li>
                <li>If the weather is nice, there is an open beach by Merlin's Cave where you can take a dip.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Just to set your expectations appropriately, Tintagel Castle is made up of ruins and striking landscapes
            these days. The location is absolutely breathtaking and the history (and legends) of the place are very
            interesting, so it’s definitely worth a visit.</p>

        <p>We wandered through the grounds for 3 hours, taking in the jagged cliffs, ancient ruins and rich backstory of
            the place. It was the perfect way to start our Cornish adventure.</p>

        <p>After that we were pretty tired and still had a bit to drive to our accommodation, so we opted to head there.
            But we had a couple of back up activities in case we wanted to add a bit more exploring to our day.</p>

        <h4>Back up option 1: St Nectan’s Waterfall</h4>
        <p>If there is sufficient daylight time left (and, let’s be honest, enough leftover energy in you), head over to
            St Nectan's Waterfall.</p>

        <div class="logistics">
            <h5>Logistics and details of St Nectan’s Waterfall walk</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Official website: https://www.st-nectansglen.co.uk/ </li>
                <li>Recommended <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/england/cornwall/st-nectan-s-glen-waterfall-circular">trail</a> to follow</li>
                <li>Duration: 1h</li>
                <li>Distance: 2.7 km / 1.7 mi</li>
                <li>Opening times: 09.00am to 5.00pm. LAST ENTRY & ADMISSION IS 4.30PM</li>
                <li>Tickets: 9 pounds/adult, 5 pounds/child, purchased on site on the day of your visit</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        

        <h4>Back up option 2: Newquay</h4>
        <p>Pass through Newquay and walk around the charming seaside town.</p>

        <p>Winding down on the first day of the Cornish road trip, we headed over to our accommodation. We chose The
            Honeydew (https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtjKHG4eA3p6ZgJ47, ver de poner link de Booking?) in Penzance that suited
            our needs for the first night and left us closer to our starting point for the following day. But any place
            in Penzance or St Ives would probably be serviceable for this itinerary. </p>

        <p>We went out for dinner to the Dolphin Tavern (https://maps.app.goo.gl/QNV2KGqNcGdCNFNB7) and had great Steak
            and Ale pies for dinner, the perfect bookend for the first day.</p>
