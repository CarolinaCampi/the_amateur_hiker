        <h1>6 day trips from London</h1>

        <p>
            During our stay in London, we had the opportunity to visit a few of the areas and towns a train ride away. These
        include seaside and countryside and there is something for everyone: from trails to historic architecture.
        </p>

        <h2>Railcard and trains</h2>
        <p>Regarding British trains, I found them to work generally well: they are mostly on time and in good
            conditions. But we have experienced a few delays on different trips in the past years. It’s good to know
            that you can apply for delay repay on the webpage of the train company. The application for compensation,
            usually consisting of a long online form, is not the most user-friendly, and the pages can be finicky, but
            it can be worth it depending on the amount of time lost and the price paid for the ticket.</p>

        <p>Another consideration that makes travelling by train more accessible, price-wise, are railcards. <a
                href=”https://www.railcard.co.uk/” target=”_blank”>Railcards</a> allow the owner to get 1/3 off the
            price of most train fares. There are several types of Railcards and each type has a specific criteria. For
            example, to be eligible for the 16-25 Railcard you have to be between 16 and 25 years old or in full-time
            education. Another example is Two Together Railcard where the benefit is 1/3 off for adult fares for two
            named people travelling together aged 16 and over. Most Railcardsare priced at just £35 for a 1-year
            Railcard. So, depending on how many trips, and the price of the trips, it may be a good investment for you.
            According to <a href=”https://www.railcard.co.uk/” target=”_blank”>Railcard.co.uk</a>, “Typically, the cost
            of your Railcard will have paid for itself after 1 or 2 trips.” 
        </p>

        <p>Another way to save some money while travelling by train is to have date flexibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel off-peak: avoid rush hour (typically 7-9am and 5-7pm during weekdays) since it's when more
                expensive tickets are.
            </li>
            <li>Travel mid-week: try to avoid Fridays and weekends since these are usually the most expensive days to
                take the train.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Brighton</h2>
        <p>Brighton is an iconic seaside town in East Sussex, England, 47 miles / 76 km south of London. Connected with
            a direct train, it's one of the classic day trips to take when visiting London to breathe fresh sea air.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>
        <p>London and Brighton are connected by the Thameslink train. You can hop on this train in several stations in
            London such as London Bridge, London St Pancras’ International and London Blackfriars. This makes it one of
            the more convenient day trips from London, as you are not tied to a specific station and can choose the most
            practical one for you.</p>
        <p>Tickets start at £23.80 for an Off-Peak Day Return. Depending on the availability of ticket types, which are
            varied and complex in the UK train ticket system, the prices could be higher. It’s more likely to get
            cheaper tickets when purchased in advance and for weekday trips.</p>
        <p>The train ride lasts around 1 hour, depending on which station you hop on, with few stops along the way.</p>

        <h3>What to do</h3>
        <p>To start with, as is the case with many destinations, I would recommend walking around and exploring. Most
            attractions are walking distance from the station. There are cute smaller side streets and alleys worth
            visiting.
            What to do: Royal Pavilion, Brighton Pier, Brighton Beach,


        <p>There are a few classic landmarks in Brighton that you could include in your visit.</p>

        <h4>Brighton Beach</h4>
        <p>A must see on every trip to Brighton is the beach. Even on an overcast day, as the one with had, you can walk
            along the shore, sit and relax and try to spot France. It's a shingle beach and most days you will see
            somebody taking a dip.

        <h5>Piers</h5>

        The only thing that remains from the first of Brighton’s piers, the Chain Pier, are weathered pillars of stone
        and wood that can be seen in low tide to the right of the still standing Palace Pier.

        The Palace Pier, formally known as Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, features a funfair including fairground
        rides, arcade halls and food stands.
        We visited on a rainy day where most of the outdoors rides and features were closed. I would still recommend
        sitting in one of the benches facing the sea and enjoying the view for a while.
