        <h1>6 day trips from London</h1>

        <p>
            During our stay in London, we had the opportunity to visit a few of the areas and towns a train ride away.
            These
            include seaside and countryside and there is something for everyone: from trails to historic architecture.
        </p>

        <h2>Railcard and trains</h2>

        <p>Regarding British trains, I found them to work generally well: they are mostly on time and in good
            conditions. But we have experienced a few delays on different trips in the past years. It’s good to know
            that you can apply for delay repay on the webpage of the train company. The application for compensation,
            usually consisting of a long online form, is not the most user-friendly, and the pages can be finicky, but
            it can be worth it depending on the amount of time lost and the price paid for the ticket.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/london_day_trips_cover_2.png"
            alt="2 picture collage: Train tracks in Rye station.">

        <p>Another consideration that makes travelling by train more accessible, price-wise, are railcards. <a
                href="https://www.railcard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Railcards</a> allow the owner to get 1/3 off the
            price of most train fares. There are several types of Railcards and each type has a specific criteria. For
            example, to be eligible for the 16-25 Railcard you have to be between 16 and 25 years old or in full-time
            education. Another example is Two Together Railcard where the benefit is 1/3 off for adult fares for two
            named people travelling together aged 16 and over. Most Railcardsare priced at just £35 for a 1-year
            Railcard. So, depending on how many trips, and the price of the trips, it may be a good investment for you.
            According to <a href="https://www.railcard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Railcard.co.uk</a>, “Typically, the cost
            of your Railcard will have paid for itself after 1 or 2 trips."
        </p>

        <p>Another way to save some money while travelling by train is to have date flexibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel off-peak: avoid rush hour (typically 7-9am and 5-7pm during weekdays) since it's when more
                expensive tickets are.
            </li>
            <li>Travel mid-week: try to avoid Fridays and weekends since these are usually the most expensive days to
                take the train.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/brighton_0.jpg" alt="Brighton beach view of Palace Pier">

        <h2>Brighton</h2>
        <p>Brighton is an iconic seaside town in East Sussex, England, 47 miles / 76 km south of London. Connected with
            a direct train, it's one of the classic day trips to take when visiting London to breathe fresh sea air.</p>

        <p>When we visited, the day was overcast and it rained on and off through out the day. With the help of rain
            jackets and umbrellas, we managed to wander around and visit most of what we had in mind.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>
        <p>London and Brighton are connected by the Thameslink train. You can hop on this train in several stations in
            London such as London Bridge, London St Pancras’ International and London Blackfriars. This makes it one of
            the more convenient day trips from London, as you are not tied to a specific station and can choose the most
            practical one for you.</p>
        <p>Tickets start at £23.80 for an Off-Peak Day Return. Depending on the availability of ticket types, which are
            varied and complex in the UK train ticket system, the prices could be higher. It’s more likely to get
            cheaper tickets when purchased in advance and for weekday trips.</p>
        <p>The train ride lasts around 1 hour, depending on which station you hop on, with few stops along the way.</p>


        <h3>What to do</h3>
        <p>To start with, as is the case with many destinations, I would recommend walking around and exploring. Most
            attractions are walking distance from the station. There are cute smaller side streets and alleys worth
            visiting. Don't forget to get fish and chips and ice cream.

        <p>There are a few classic landmarks in Brighton that you could include in your visit.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/brighton_5.jpg" alt="Brighton beach view">

        <h4>Brighton Beach</h4>
        <p>A must see on every trip to Brighton is the beach. Even on an overcast day, as the one with had, you can walk
            along the shore, sit and relax and try to spot France. It's a shingle beach and most days you will see
            somebody taking a dip.

        <h5>Piers</h5>

        <p>The only thing that remains from the first of Brighton’s piers, the Chain Pier, are weathered pillars of
            stone
            and wood that can be seen in low tide to the right of the still standing Palace Pier.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/brighton_3.jpg" alt="Palace Pier in Brighton">

        The Palace Pier, formally known as Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, features a funfair including fairground
        rides, arcade halls and food stands.
        We visited on a rainy day where most of the outdoors rides and features were closed. I would still recommend
        sitting in one of the benches facing the sea and enjoying the view for a while.

            and
            down the main structure, rising to 138 metres above the ground, making it the highest British observation
            tower
            outside of London.</p>

        <h2>Dover + Canterbury</h2>

        <p>While the combination might be a bit random, both cities are to the east of London and, if you want to
            maximize the bang for your buck and train time, combinations like this one might be for you. You can see the
            coast and get the typical mediaeval town experience on the same outing.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>

        <p>To get to Dover from London, you have to go to St Pancras International station and take the Southeastern
            train headed to Ramsgate. After 6 stops and 66 minutes, you will arrive at Dover Priory, where you need to
            get off the train. The cost for this leg of the trip starts at £22.30 without a Railcard on weekends and
            £18.30 for weekdays.</p>

        <p>After you visited Dover, go back to the Dover Priory station and take the Southeastern train headed to London
            Victoria. This might seem weird, but this service passes through Canterbury. The train takes half an hour to
            get there and has 7 stops before reaching Canterbury East station. The tickets for this journey start at
            £11.00, for any day of the week.</p>

        <p>Finally, when you are ready to go back to London, walk to Canterbury West station. There are alternatives for
            this leg:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Southeastern train to St Pancras International station. The ride lasts around an hour and has 4 stops.
                These tickets start at £18.20.
            </li>
            <li>Southeastern train to London Charing Cross station. The ride lasts 1 hour and 47 minutes and has 13
                stops. These tickets start at £13.50.
            </li>
            <li>Southeastern train towards London Victoria station. The ride lasts around an hour and a half and has 10
                stops. These tickets start at £16.30.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>While the train ride to St Pancras International is the shortest, it might be more convenient and/or overall
            faster for you to take one of the other trains, if it means less time in the Tube/bus within London.</p>


        <h3>What to do</h3>

        <h4>Dover</h4>

        <p>I can’t quite place how the idea of visiting Dover was planted in my brain. I have a slight suspicion that it
            happened reading an extract or a poem in English Literature class when I was a teen. In any case, I knew I
            wanted to visit the famous White Cliffs. The draw for some people is the rich history associated with WWI
            and WWII. You can take a ferry to France from Dover and, on clear days, you can see France from the coast of
            Dover.</p>

        <p>When we arrived at the station, it was raining and we could not see France at all. So we put on our raincoats
            and headed to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/32FdfukPJNvGvpEk8" target="_blank">The White Cliffs of
                Dover</a>. On the way we stopped for hash browns and a coffee at <a
                href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nQjCVgdyzk8RVN549" target="_blank">Costa Coffee</a>. We continued walking
            and arrive to the start of the trail, where you can do a toilet <a
                href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HZJfGbSrEv2gRGbo6" target="_blank">stop</a>.</p>

        <p>The path is easy to follow and there are <a
                href="https://nt.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website/national/regions/kent/places/the-white-cliffs-of-dover/pdf/white-cliffs-map-web-nov-22_1.pdf">maps</a>
            available as well. We followed the trail all the way to the South Foreland Lighthouse.</p>

        <p>It took us about an hour with many stops for pictures along the way, because of the beautiful views. The path
            is mostly flat with a few ups and downs. It's well maintained, so no special shoes are needed. Though I do
            recommend comfortable walking shoes, sport shoes or hiking shoes.</p>

        <p>On the other side of the path, you will find tall grasses, fields of flowers and a few shrubs and trees, the
            perfect complement to the stark cliffs.</p>

        <p>In the lighthouse area, we stopped to rest for a bit and had a snack we brought with us. There is a shop with
            a few offerings, but I would recommend taking your own as back up, or in case you feel peckish along the
            way.</p>

        <p>On the way back, we took a small detour and descended Langdon Stairs on to Langdon Bay. The descent includes
            a tunnel into the cliff, after which you emerge to vertical stairs that lead to the beach itself. It's quite
            an experience if you are up for it. We sat for a bit enjoying the view and the sound of the waves.</p>

        <p class="recommendation"><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The Langdon Stairs and Bay have rougher terrain with
            a steeper descent and uneven ground. Be prepared for this if you want to visit this part. Another important
            thing to keep in mind is the tide. The beach is very short and susceptible to changes in sea levels. While
            visiting, always be vigilant of the tide to avoid accidents.</p>

        <p>Another of the features of The White Cliffs of Dover is the presence of tunnels dug under the order of
            Winston Churchill. The Fan Bay Deep Shelter was discovered relatively recently by the National Trust and was
            reopened in 2015 to visitors. The labyrinth of tunnels go deep and include 125 steps to get to them.</p>

        <h2>Winchester</h2>

        <p>This city in the county of Hampshire sits within the South Downs National Park. Characterized by its
            mediaeval streets and the Winchester Cathedral, it's perfect for a day trip in the English countryside.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>

        <p>South Western Railway is the train company that covers the trip from London to Winchester. Specifically, the
            train departs from Waterloo station and Weymouth is the final destination. It stops in Winchester after
            passing one or two other stops. The journey lasts a little less than an hour. Trains depart every 30 minutes
            from Waterloo station, so it should be easy to take the one that’s most convenient for you. Return tickets
            start at £46.60, without a Railcard, on a weekend, while tickets on weekdays start at £41.80.</p>

        <p>When we visited Winchester, we were lucky and caught a festival called A Taste of WInchester that included
            lots of food stalls, activities and street performances. It seemed a great place to visit with families and
            friends alike.</p>

        <p>Here a few ideas and attractions found in the Winchester area:</p>

        <h4>Winchester Cathedral</h4>

        <p>Wander around in this beautiful building from the 11th century that is the resting place of Jane Austen. You
            can enjoy the gardens as well. If the weather is nice, the front lawn is perfect for a picnic.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/winchester_3.jpg" alt="River Itchen and the trail beside it">


        <h4>Walk along the River Itchen</h4>

        <p>There is nothing like a stroll by the river following The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail. It is a 10 miles
            /
            16 km trail that can be done partially or completely. The path is well marked and mostly flat, making it
            appropriate for most visitors. The <a

                target="_blank">brochure</a> has additional information and a map.</p>


        <h4>Winchester City Mill</h4>

        <p>This historic mill is free to visit. It has a café with an island garden facing the river and it's considered
            a
            wildlife spot in the heart of Winchester. If you are not interested in the history of the building or the
            flour
            mill process, it's still worth a visit to see the garden.</p>

            alt="2 picture collage: Winchester Mill, Wolvesey Castle ruins">

        <h4>Wolvesey Castle</h4>

        <p> Wolvesey used to be the residence of the Bishops of Winchester in the Middle Ages. Now well preserved ruins
            dating all the way back to the 12th century, you can walk and imagine the once grand home of advisers to the
            king. Wolvesey Castle is free to enter. You can find more details <a

        <h4>Jane Austen's House</h4>

        <p>A bit further out of the city, you can find Jane Austen’s house, a great stopping point for literature or
            history fans. They recommended to reserved tickets in advance at <a hre="https://janeaustens.house/"
                target="_blank">https://janeaustens.house/</a>. Opening days and times should also be confirmed in the
            official site mentioned before. 2025 is the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth, so it's a busy and
            exciting year to visit the lovely Hampshire cottage.</p>

        <h4>Walk or bike along Viaduct Way</h4>

        <p>We only walk a part of this trail, but I highly recommend it, especially for bike lovers. You can find the
            brochure with the map and additional information <a
                href="https://visit-winchester.files.svdcdn.com/production/Viaduct-Way.pdf?v=1719830134&dm=1719830134"

            and
            Wolvesey Castle. It includes Hockley Viaduct, where you can stop and gaze into the surrounding fields and
            river.</p>

        <h2>Surrey Hills: Box Hill</h2>

        <p>The Surrey Hills National Landscape is an area southwest of London. A few of the places you can visit within
            in are Box Hill, Leith Hill and Hindhead Commons and the Devils Punch Bowl.</p>

        <p>When we visited, we went to a trail in the Box Hill area specifically.</p>

        <h3>How to get there from London</h3>

        <p>Starting at Waterloo station, get on the South Western Railway train headed to Dorking. Ride it for 13 stops
            and 47 minutes and get off the train at Box Hill & Westhumble station. </p>

        <p>The tickets start at £15.50 for a return journey without a Railcard any day of the week.</p>

        <p>Take advantage of the view on the second leg of the trip. The hills start to appear and the landscape is
            beautiful.</p>

        <h3>What to do</h3>

        <p>Once you get to Box Hill station, there are a bunch of trails on the Surrey Hills characteristic of the area.
            You can walk to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdkgphtQttxzdmin8" target="_blank">Box Hill Shephard’s Hut
                Information Stand</a> where there are toilets, maps with possible trails, a parking lot and a café, so
            it’s a good starting point.</p>

        <img src="../../data/london-day-trips/box_hill_1.png"
            alt="3 picture collage: dirt trail in a grassy hill, short stone tower, trail bordered by green trees and shrubs">

        <p>We followed <a

                target="_blank">this trail</a> but we got lost near the end. And instead of retracing our steps we
            decided to head over to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AuRA9F75ZjmifycT9" target="_blank">Stepping
                Stones</a>. From the Stepping Stones, we headed back to the station.</p>

        <p class="recommendation">If you are going to embark on one of the longer trails, be mindful to carry sufficient
            water and food with you. Some of the trails don't have places to replenish along the way.</p>
